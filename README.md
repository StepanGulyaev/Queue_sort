This code adds a vector based Queue class with all basic methods of interaction with it.
Except that, there is also an in-built insertion sorting with operation counter. 
Main code just coninuely sorts Queue of diffrent sizes (from 300 to 3000) and random input, then gives you time and number of operations it takes to sort.
Enjoy
